We used downscaled projected future rainfall and potential evapotranspiration based on projected temperature from six General Circulation Models (CanESM2, CNRM, CSIRO, HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES, and MIROC5) and two scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) to force the GR4J model. [The GR4J model was calibrated and validated using observed daily rainfall, potential evapotranspiration from observed daily temperature, and streamflow data. For the cross-validation, two periods for each river basin were considered: 1961–1982 and 1983–2004 for the Senegal River Basin at Bafing Makana, and 1969–1985 and 1986–2000 for the Gambia River Basin at Mako. Model efficiency is evaluated using a multi-criteria function (Fagg) which aggregates Nash and Sutcliffe criteria, cumulative volume error, and mean volume error. Alternating periods of simulation for calibration and validation were used. This process allows us to choose the parameters that best reflect the rainfall-runoff relationship. Once the model was calibrated and validated, we simulated streamflow at Bafing Makana and Mako stations in the near future at a daily scale. The characteristic flow rates were calculated to evaluate their possible evolution under the projected climate scenarios at the 2050 horizon. For the near future (2050 horizon), compared to the 1971–2000 reference period, results showed that for both river basins, multi-model ensemble predicted a decrease of annual streamflow from 8% (Senegal River Basin) to 22% (Gambia River Basin) under the RCP4.5 scenario. Under the RCP8.5 scenario, the decrease is more pronounced: 16% (Senegal River Basin) and 26% (Gambia River Basin).

In this study, the evolution of extreme floods is analyzed over the period 1950–2015 for seven tributaries in the Sudano-Guinean part of the Senegal River basin and four data sets in the Sahelian part of the Niger River basin. [Non-stationary Generalized Extreme Value (NS-GEV) distributions including twelve models with time-dependent parameters plus a stationary GEV are applied to annual maxima of daily discharge (AMAX) series. An original methodology is proposed for comparing GEV models and selecting the best for use. The stationary GEV is rejected for all stations, demonstrating the significant non-stationarity of extreme discharge values in West Africa over the past six decades. The model of best fit most commonly selected is a double-linear model for the central tendency parameter ($\\mu$), with the dispersion parameter ($\\delta$) modeled as either stationary, linear, or a double-linear. Change points in double-linear models are relatively consistent for the Senegal basin, with stations switching from a decreasing streamflow trend to an increasing streamflow trend in the early 1980s. In the Niger basin the trend in $\\mu$ is generally positive since the 1970s with an increase in slope after the change point, but the change point location is less consistent. The recent increasing trends in extreme discharges are reflected in an especially marked increase in return level magnitudes since the 1980s in the studied Sahelian rivers. The rate of the increase indicated by the study results raises urgent considerations for stakeholders and engineers who are in charge of river basin management and hydraulic works sizing.]{.abstract}\n\n## {{< fa note-sticky >}} FATY, B., ALI, A., DACOSTA, H., BODIAN, A., DIOP, S., & DESCROIX, L.

The Gambia Basin in West Africa provides a good example of a case where the use of satellite precipitation estimates could be beneficial. This study aims to compare three SRE over a 12-year periods (1998-2010), before and after their integration into the GR4J hydrological model over the Gambia Basin. [The inter-compared products are Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS), Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR) and TRMM 3B42v7 (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission). The calibration and validation of the GR4J model over the Gambia basin using a reference rainfall product (RRP) pointed out a very good performance.

Finally, a bias correction is applied to the SRE using the RRP. The bias correction had significantly improved the product performance. On average, the bias fell from 100 to 1.5% compared to the RRP, but the impact on the error is less significant.

The Penman-Monteith ETo equation showed good performance under missing solar radiation, relative humidity and wind speed and could still be adapted under limited data conditions across New Mexico.

Characterizing extreme rainfall distribution in a coherent way in space and time is thus becoming an overarching need that requires using appropriate models of intensity–duration–frequency (IDF) curves. [Using a 14 series of 5 min rainfall records collected in Senegal, a comparison of two generalized extreme value (GEV) and scaling models is carried out, resulting in the selection of the more parsimonious one (four parameters), as the recommended model for use. A bootstrap approach is proposed to compute the uncertainty associated with the estimation of these four parameters and of the related rainfall return levels for durations ranging from 1 to 24 h. This study confirms previous works showing that simple scaling holds for characterizing the temporal scaling of extreme rainfall in tropical regions such as sub-Saharan Africa. It further provides confidence intervals for the parameter estimates and shows that the uncertainty linked to the estimation of the GEV parameters is 3 to 4 times larger than the uncertainty linked to the inference of the scaling parameter. From this model, maps of IDF parameters over Senegal are produced, providing a spatial vision of their organization over the country, with a north to south gradient for the location and scale parameters of the GEV.

Air temperature, relative humidity temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed were collected from 22 weather stations across the country and were used to estimate daily reference evapotranspiration (ETo) by the Penman-Monteith equation. Monthly average daily ETo and the total annual ETo were estimated. [The Mann-Kendall test was used for the temporal trend analysis in monthly average daily ETo and the total annual ETo and the Sen’s method was used to estimate the rate of change in ETo during the study period. The spline interpolation method was used for spatial interpolation of the variation in annual and monthly average ETo. The results showed southwest-north East trend in ETo. Reference evapotranspiration was higher at the western semiarid region than the humid eastern region. ETo peaked during the period of September-October. Annual total ETo varied from 1,081 mm in Andapa at northeast to 2,239 mm in Antsohihy at northwestern coastal region. Overall, there was an increasing trend in annual total ETo; however, the upward trend was significant only at 7 out of 22 weather station sites while monthly ETo did not show consistent trends. This is one of the first comprehensive studies that investigate spatial and temporal dynamics of ETo in Madagascar, which can aid in developing appropriate adaptation strategies to improve crop water use and evaporative losses estimates for maintaining or increasing food production while enhancing water use efficiency in the western semiarid regions of Madagascar.

In the last two decades, the potential of soft computing approaches has increased dramatically in engineering and science problems. In this research, the utility of two soft computing approaches, namely support vector regression (SVR) model and generalized regression neural network (GRNN) is validated to predict one day ahead daily river flow data in the upper Senegal River basin at the Bafing Makana station in West Africa. [The modeling is conducted by including the climatological information in the modelled stream-flow patterns. Correlation procedure is established and applied to obtain the modeling of the input variables with statistically significant lagged datasets at t-1, t-2, and t-3 used as three input combination for each case study scenario. Different statistical indicators are used to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction models. The results show that the accuracy of the models varied by the scenario and the input datasets, where the SVR model yielded the best results for both modelling scenarios. It is also evident that combining the historical stream-flow data with the rainfall and evapotranspiration, can ameliorate substantially the accuracy of the two models for predicting one day ahead stream-flow. A comparison of the optimal SVR and GRNN models in this problem indicates that SVR exhibits superior performance to the GRNN model in estimating the daily stream-flow data, irrespective of the modelling scenario and the datasets that is applied. The findings offer an opportunity to apply SVR model for predicting daily stream-flow, with less data requirement for the investigated Senegal river basin.]{.abstract}","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n{{< include utils.qmd >}}\n\n## {{< fa note-sticky >}} Bodian, Ansoumana, Alain Dezetter, Lamine Diop, Abdoulaye Deme, Koffi Djaman, and Aliou Diop. 2018. \"Future Climate Change Impacts on Streamflows of Two Main West Africa River Basins: Senegal and Gambia\" Hydrology 5, no. 1: 21.

[The Mann-Kendall test was used for the temporal trend analysis in monthly average daily ETo and the total annual ETo and the Sen’s method was used to estimate the rate of change in ETo during the study period. The spline interpolation method was used for spatial interpolation of the variation in annual and monthly average ETo. The results showed southwest-north East trend in ETo. Reference evapotranspiration was higher at the western semiarid region than the humid eastern region. ETo peaked during the period of September-October. Annual total ETo varied from 1,081 mm in Andapa at northeast to 2,239 mm in Antsohihy at northwestern coastal region. Overall, there was an increasing trend in annual total ETo; however, the upward trend was significant only at 7 out of 22 weather station sites while monthly ETo did not show consistent trends. This is one of the first comprehensive studies that investigate spatial and temporal dynamics of ETo in Madagascar, which can aid in developing appropriate adaptation strategies to improve crop water use and evaporative losses estimates for maintaining or increasing food production while enhancing water use efficiency in the western semiarid regions of Madagascar.

The influence of climatic inputs on stream-flow pattern forecasting: case study of Upper Senegal River. Environ Earth Sci 77, 182 (2018). [https://doi.org/10.1007/s12665-018-7376-8](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12665-018-7376-8){target=\"_blank\"}\nIdeal prediction and modeling of stream-flow and its hydrological applications is extremely significant for decision-making tasks and proper planning of water resource and hydraulic engineering. In the last two decades, the potential of soft computing approaches has increased dramatically in engineering and science problems. In this research, the utility of two soft computing approaches, namely support vector regression (SVR) model and generalized regression neural network (GRNN) is validated to predict one day ahead daily river flow data in the upper Senegal River basin at the Bafing Makana station in West Africa. [The modeling is conducted by including the climatological information in the modelled stream-flow patterns. Correlation procedure is established and applied to obtain the modeling of the input variables with statistically significant lagged datasets at t-1, t-2, and t-3 used as three input combination for each case study scenario. Different statistical indicators are used to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction models. The results show that the accuracy of the models varied by the scenario and the input datasets, where the SVR model yielded the best results for both modelling scenarios. It is also evident that combining the historical stream-flow data with the rainfall and evapotranspiration, can ameliorate substantially the accuracy of the two models for predicting one day ahead stream-flow. A comparison of the optimal SVR and GRNN models in this problem indicates that SVR exhibits superior performance to the GRNN model in estimating the daily stream-flow data, irrespective of the modelling scenario and the datasets that is applied. The findings offer an opportunity to apply SVR model for predicting daily stream-flow, with less data requirement for the investigated Senegal river basin.]{.abstract}"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"2018.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
